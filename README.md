## 📝 Project Overview

This app allows users to:
- **Input tumor feature values** to predict whether the tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign**.
- **View interactive visualizations** of prediction results.
- **Leverage a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for reliable, high-accuracy predictions based on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive UI**: Built using **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface.
- **High Accuracy**: The **ANN model** achieves an impressive accuracy of **96.74%**.
- **Breast Cancer Awareness**: The application design incorporates visuals aligned with the **Breast Cancer Awareness** theme.
